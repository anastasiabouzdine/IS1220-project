\section{Conclusion and further work} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have now defined the necessary \emph{background} to understand
what the \emph{requierements} were about and explained how we \emph{designed} 
our solution to meet those. We also described how this 
\emph{implementation} was conducted effectively throughout the code
and what \emph{testing} methods have been used to ensure stability
and correctness.


See who did what in appendix~\ref{app:who_did_what}.
% advantages/limitations of your solution
% why we did not use test driven development
% what about one test for each class
% what about the test sceneria and results ? --> not useful if not real scenario and way
% more representative with commands as in CLUI
