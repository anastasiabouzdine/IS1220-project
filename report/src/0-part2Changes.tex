  \textbf{What is new in part 2 ?}
  
  Some parts of the report have been modified and others added.

  More precisely, the introduction was slightly modified to
  tie in the updated report.
  Then a complete section~\ref{sec:user_interface} on
  the implementation of the user interfaces has been added.
  The results obtained when using both have been described in section~\ref{sec:results}.
  As we designed more classes, there are also new UML diagrams and code listings
  in the appendix.
  Finally, the conclusion has been updated to consider further work and
  make a general comment on the advantages and disadvantages of our solution.
